CASIO CT-660 Percussion Bank
----------------------------

   This SBK consists of the most useful percussion  presets from 
my MIDI  keyboard CT-660. Sounds  are rather chip but not enough
to be completely ignored. It's still useful to use analog cheapy
sounds in modern music, so go ahead!
   Any comments or suggestions?
