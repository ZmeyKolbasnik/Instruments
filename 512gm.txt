         SoundFont 2.0 bank for 512K SoundBlaster AWE32/64 Users
                           -= Revision B =-


Why I made this bank?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since I found out that many instrument in the original 1MB ROM sounds 
weird, I just tried to make my own bank. It uses 511K out of the maximum 
512K RAM onboard. Hope you'll enjoy it.
