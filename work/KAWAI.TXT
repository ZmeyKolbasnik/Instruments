All of you with 8mb ram (or more)!!!
You have to hear this piano. I have sampled this from
my friend´s good sounding Kawai piano.

I don´t know if there´s any use for this BIG soundfont, but
HEAR the reality!

kawai.sf2 contains many STEREO 44,1Khz samples, that´s why
the big file size!


You are FREE to use this soundfont, there is NOT copyrights!
(can you find better piano everywhere else for free??!)
