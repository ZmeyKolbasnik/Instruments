* file contents
my_15mgm.sbk : 1.5 MegaBytes GM bank file for SB AWE32
my_15mgm.txt : This file


* descriptions
  This bank is an effort to make AWE sound better. I recently downloaded
a 2MB GM bank(finegm.sbk created by Ivan Blumenschein) and enjoyed it. I
think that the finegm.sbk is very good but that its size is too large for 
loading user sample on my 2MB RAM. So I decided to convert the 2MB GM bank
into 1.5MB GM bank.  

  Loading this bank on AWE with 2MB ram, you can still use 507KB free and 
I think this size is large enough for most of midi music requiring user bank. 

* usage
  There  three ways to use this bank as your main GM bank.
  A. Windows 3.1 users
   1.Copy the "my_15mgm.sbk" to your sfbank subdirectory(maybe c:\sb16\asfbank).
   Edit your \WINDOWS\SBWIN.INI file.  Below the
   [AWE32], in the line
   user ...
   complete it;
         user=c:\sb16\sfbank\my_15mgm.sbk
   Run WINDOWS. In AWE Control Panel, choose USER CUSTOM BANK.
   All your windows applications will now use this bank as bank 0.
   2. Just copy the my_15mgm.sbk to your sfbank directory with the name synthgm.sbk.
   (It overwrites your old GM bank, so backup it.)

  B. Windows 95 users
   If you using Windows 95 with the latest driver of AWE32, you will have 
  the New AWE32 Control Panel. In this case, you can load the my_15mgm.sbk as
  General Midi bank. 

* comments
   This file is NOT tested for all the existing midi file, and I'm NOT so experienced 
in handling the AWE's soundfont banks. So, this file may contain some problems playing 
music. If this file sounds worse, you can replace it as your original GM bank.
