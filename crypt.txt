The AWE gives you five different organs, but none of them is a good old evil Bach-Toccata-playin'-Phantom-of-the-Opera-type-power-of-the-music-of-the-night-pipe-organ-from-hell kinda sound.  Riding to the rescue is CRYPT.SBK, with an organ taken straight from the opening theme to "Tales from the Crypt."  It was sampled straight off a CD, digital-to-digital, and it will scare your neighbors if you turn the volume up too loud.  I spent an hour edging dangerously close to insanity getting the loop points EXACTLY right, with no annoying "pop" sound, so drop me a line at

to reward me for all my hard work.

P.S. If you find yourself in the enviable position of having a few bucks to spare, pick up Danny Elfman's "Music for a Darkened Theatre" CD (the source of the Crypt Organ.)  The music's Eastern European Gothic style is unlike anything you'll hear anywhere else, and the outlandish instruments he uses will keep you in samples until the end of the world.  (Which, according to my psychotic ex-girlfriend, will be the year 2004.  So get cracking.)
