Have you been waiting for an EXCELLENT piano soundfont??!
- THIS IS IT!! (but it needs lots of memory)
Samples are from Roland U-20. (44.1khz/stereo)
I didn´t make any loops, so you can try it.
Great for house, club, techno...

(Another U-20 piano will be here soon - including loops!, and
 it will be better for classic styles)
