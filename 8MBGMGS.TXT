************************
Although Creative has a free 2mbgmgs.sf2 on the Internet, this soundfont 
is NOT from, or related to Creative/Emu. The offical Creative's 8Mb 
soundfont are called 8mbgm.sf2 and 8mbgmsfx.sf2.
************************

The 8mbgmgs.sf2 is free for anyone who has a SB32/AWE32/AWE64 soundcard
with at least 8Mb RAM on the soundcard.

After posting the 5mbgmgs.sf2 to the Internet around the same time last year, 
I have received a lot of valuable comments and encouragements from all sort 
of AWE-jammers all over the world. Thank you to everyone who has tried my 
5mbgmgs.sf2, especially for those who have recommended my soundfont to the 
others in the Usenet.

Same as the 5mb one, all the instruments in the 8mbgmgs.sf2 are collected
from the Internet, with some fine adjustments have been made on them. There
are also many others good quality 8mb GM/GS soundfont on the Internet, like 
the Ultra 8Mb, 8Mb Chaos or the RealGS 1.0/2.0 . In my opinion, each General 
Midi soundfonts has their own strength, eg. some soundfonts have excellent 
drum/bass sound, but have cheesy ensemble or melodic sound. The offical 8Mb
soundfonts from the Creative/Emu produces high quality 16bit sound, but many 
instruements sound extraordinary weak and lacks of FX (or "mass"). Because
of these, I have tried to maintain good quality in both melodic instrumnets
and percussions in my 8Mb soundfont.

The 8mbgmgs.sf2 is ideal for playing back General Midi/General Standard
files. If you would like to have high quality instrumental sounds when 
composing your song, you could create and customerize your own soundfont. 
(This is one of the selling points of the AWE series from Creative). 8Mb 
capacity is not enough to squeeze in 128 high quality instrumental sounds.

The 8mbgmgs.sf2 is GM/GS compatible, with a CM64L Drum Set.

The size is 8,245,310 bytes.

Please send any comment to me after trying this GM soundfont, I will
reply every emails that I've received.

Happy AWEing all the time!!!

The 5mbgmgs.sf2 is free to use to anyone. All the instruments sample
are collected from the internet. Note that only a few instrumenets are
using the default ROM sample.

I have seen some of the 2Mb/6Mb/8Mb soundfonts from the internet, but
they all sound unevenly. Some of the instruments in certain bank are
ridiculous, but some of the instruments in the same bank sounds very good.
Because of this I reorganised ALL the instrumnets from those different
banks. Hope everyone will like this soundfont bank!

The SF2 bank is GM/GS compatible. The size is 4912136 bytes.

If someone have any comment, or recommendation, don't hesitate to drop me
a line!

Keep on AWEing all the time!!!
