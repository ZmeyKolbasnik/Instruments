Vocoder.sbk is a simple demonstration of my upcoming vocoding program for the entire 
SB16/AWE32/SB32 family which will come out in a non-realtime version at first and then a
pitch tracking version and then a full, full duplex version.
The actual sample in Vocoder.sbk is my own rendition of the first vocode recording ever, done
through a true electronic (dual banpass chain) vocoder.
The actual text is "This is a 10 band vocoder, designed by R.A. Moog in the summer of 1969", and
was said by the famous Wendy Carlos.
The actual vocode in Vocode.sbk is only my own version of the text spoken in 196?, and
contains not one single sample from the origional recording.
The text (my voice) was sampled at 22K and normalized.
The carrier is a simple sustained sampling of the echo drop patch from the Roland SCD-15, also
sampled at 22K and normalized.
The resulting file was a mono 22K file which I normalized, then converted to .SBK format
with a dual layer with the second layer slightly pitch bended to produce a slight flange effect.
Echo and Reverb are at full and sound best with Plate or Hall2 and Chorus3.
Listen very carefully to the vocoding since it is quite pure and tricks the mind into
thinking it's some sort of voice trick until I change the pitch on the carrier and suddenly
the pitch of the voice goes with the carrier like magic, proving that it's a real vocoder,
not just a simulated effect, like the famous echo trick that has become popular lately.
Take Care and look for the software announce in the soundcard groups.
