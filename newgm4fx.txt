Here is a change for the NEWGM4.SBK file.  This change should be made
to the Grand Piano patch using Vienna or other SBK editor.  In addition, I
suggest the use of the FX settings in either AWE FX Workshop (awefxws)
or the newest 2.49 version of AWE Virtual BankManager (awevbank).  These
algorithms are better than the default FX algorithms.
Also note that NEWGM is not really for making your own music but listening
to MIDI.  I don't think the quality overall is really good enough for
composition though some sounds are pretty good.
