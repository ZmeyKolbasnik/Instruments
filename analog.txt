ANALOG.SBK: Analog Synth sounds  29/05/94

This sound bank contains a few classic analog synth
samples for Creative's AWE32 sound card. The bank was
created with the SBKMAKE utility and can be loaded via
the AWEControl program. There are only six samples, but 
the bank should fit into an unexpanded AWE32 (512K sample
memory).
