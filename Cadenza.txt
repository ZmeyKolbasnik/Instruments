Cadenza is a 40MB soundfont that is optimized for orchestral and wind ensembles, but will work well with most genres. 
Many of best web-based soundfont samples are included into this collection.  Some came from SB LIve's Musician's Treat, too.
Note that bank 01 isused for variations or related instruments (trumpet-cornet, clarinet-bass clarinet, bassoon-contrabassoon, etc)
I hope you will enjoy this soundfont (especially the french horn, flute, piano, tenor sax, and trumpet).
Addition of standard drums include gong and concert bass drum.  
E-mail me with your comments and advice.  
Also, if you can get samples of different mallets for mallet isntruments (and other percussion instrument-fingernail struck on concert bass drum), and also drum corp percussion (marching snare(solo & group), tenor(quad/quint) drums (solo/group), and bass drums (5-6), PLZ E-MAIL ME 'CAUSE I REALLY REALLY NEED THEM!!
