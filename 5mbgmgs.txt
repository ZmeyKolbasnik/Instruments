The 5mbgmgs.sf2 is free to use to anyone. All the instruments sample
are collected from the internet. Note that only a few instrumenets are
using the default ROM sample.

I have seen some of the 2Mb/6Mb/8Mb soundfonts from the internet, but
they all sound unevenly. Some of the instruments in certain bank are
ridiculous, but some of the instruments in the same bank sounds very good.
Because of this I reorganised ALL the instrumnets from those different
banks. Hope everyone will like this soundfont bank!

The SF2 bank is GM/GS compatible. The size is 4912136 bytes.

If someone have any comment, or recommendation, don't hesitate to drop me
a line!

Keep on AWEing all the time!!!
