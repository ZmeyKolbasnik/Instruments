AWE32 / SB32 SoundFont 1.0
----------------------------------------------------------
Roland DR-550 Drum Machine Kit (w/very light reverb) 1.8MB
----------------------------------------------------------
2MB AWE RAM Required! (I recommend 8MB if you'd like to load any other SBKs)

Mapped for General Midi Channel 10

All 48 DR-550 samples are included in this SBK. It works as a GM
drum kit quite well, though there were some modifications made
as not every Roland sound can be matched to a GM key. Noticeably 
missing are some Latin percussion, triangles, etc. (such sounds
don't exist on the 550) Also there are a few extras such as Hi-Hats,
Toms, snare and a cowbell. Look around and you'll see what I mean.
Feel free to edit or redistribute. I did not sample the instruments
myself. I found the whole set of samples somewhere on the Internet 
(can't recall where, though) and imported them as WAV files into
Vienna.
