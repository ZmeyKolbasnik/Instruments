The (identical) supplement packages contain 9 samples (.MID) with 
music by J. S. Bach, as demo for different voices. The harpsichords 
are mainly good for real time play on a masterkeyboard.
As reverb & chorus types select reverb 3 "hall1" and chorus 4 "feedback".
The sound quality is under Linux or FreeBSD much better as under Windows.
I have also the DOS version  org_harp.sbk , and DOS software,
but not published.
