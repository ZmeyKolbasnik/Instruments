- Fender strat. 68 (22050Hz 16bit)

This is the best Distorted guitar i
have ever heard. Great for those of
you who have little ram on your AWE32.
All others can use the non-downsampled
version instead.

I'd recommend using this instead of the
distorted guitar which EMU sends along
in their 8MB GM soundfont.

(I'm working on replacements for those
instruments which sound like crap in
the EMU GM soundfont at the moment.
I'll upload it at ftp.lysator.liu.se as
soon as it's been completed.)

The original soundfont came from...

http://...

(I made a downsampled version of
it (fender2.sf2) and corrected the
loops in both of them.)
