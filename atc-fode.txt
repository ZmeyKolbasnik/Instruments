Flying over distant eyes

Barcelona / 3rd Planet

My first release: a slow-dance style song without melody and
good title for Awe32 users... another garbage awe-song to listen... :(

Requirements:
- Awe32/64 with 2 Mb of DRAM.
- A standard midi player like Media Player.
Remarks:
- The sound files were compressed with RAR 2 using multimedia compression
- The soundbank format is SF2 (=street fighter 2 format).
- Upload the soundfont to user bank 1 with the AweCp.
- Set the fxs to Hall 1 and Chorus 4.
- The optimal trebel level is +6 dB.
- The optimal bass level is +0 dB.
- Don't use the 3d stereo enhancement.


Statistics at this moment:
- Total awe songs listened: around 280
- Total good songs found: around 50 (the rest are bad/garbage/pure garbage).

Be aware for next releases from Barcelona.
