A string section SoundFont. The loop points aren't perfect -- you can hear
clicks one in a while. (If you can find better loop points, please e-mail
me.) Still, probably the most *consistent* string patches around. Except for
a small section of notes from E4 to B4, the timbre of the instrument doesn't
vary much.

These samples can also be used as the foundation for the Tremolo Strings
and Slow Strings. For Tremolo Strings, simply set the Vibrato LFO to 25
cents -- you can play around with the frequency to get faster or slower
vibrato. For slow strings, just increase the attack on the Volume Envelope
to about 1 or so.

Note, you may or may not be wondering why I didn't simply create the
Tremolo and Slow Strings so you can drop them into your bank from Vienna?
Well, you may have noticed that for some reason, dragging 4MB of
instruments usually creates a 6MB bank. Quite simply, when Vienna encounters
a sample of the same name, it will rename the new sample and copy it in
regardless of whether that sample is the same or not. You can see the amount
of chaos that would be created if you had multiple instruments based on the
same samples.
