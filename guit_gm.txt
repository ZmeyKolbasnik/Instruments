This GM compatible SBK replaces all guitar patches (except for Jazz guitar),
basses + synth basses and many percussion sounds.  Everyone is more than 
welcome to modify it (as long as it sounds better :-). Samples from: K2000, 
TX16W, ROLAND, GUS, EMU demo song and other.
Feel free to let me know what you think of it. Keep in mind though that I'm
not a musician and don't have a keyboard and have no idea what a real GM is
supposed to sound like; I was choosing and tuning samples based on how Rom
samples sounded. Nevertheless, it sounds great, especially steel string guitar, ]
clean guitar and of course, drums (>1M)!

Just one more try in our common effort to make AWE sound better.
