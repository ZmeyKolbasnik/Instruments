Velpiano.sbk

Thanks to Esbeekay 1.21 for the velocity split feature ! This makes now
things sound better. Let's hear to this piano where Fc is controlled
by your hands (i.e the harder you strike the brigther it sounds).

If you're not a good pianist, I have included a midi song to demonstrate
this new feeling. To play it, put the velpiano in bank 1 with the AWE
control panel.

Enjoy !
