This SBK has been lovingly handcrafted from the ROM samples that came with the AWE.  (It takes up no RAM space.)  If you thought that some of the AWE's orchestral voices just weren't MEAN enough, here's the solution to your problems.  (Most of these use layered notes -- four at a time in 03 -- so don't go crazy with 'em.) 

00 - Mega Strings - _powerful_ blast from the string section...use sparingly
01 - Divine Hammer - funky orchestra hit with an echoing finish 
02 - Carillon - deep, cathedral-style bell (great improvement over the original Tubular Bell)
03 - Brass Flourish - Uses all the brass instruments together to replace the flat-sounding 
		     Brass Section voice
04 - Echo Cymbal - triumphant cymbal crash for a big finish
05 - Holy Choir - choir and organ for a religious atmosphere
06 - Ghostly Organ - Eerie, cheesy-horror-flick organ
07 - Repeating Marimba - marimba with an echo (not too exciting)

We'll have some coffee, we'll talk.  I'll give you a topic:  The Holy Roman Empire was neither holy nor Roman nor an empire.  Discuss.
